This migration guide currently needs to be done manually. As long as BQ 2.0 is in development, this will not change!

Before you start migrating, you should **backup your system**!

Also check your current version, so you know which migration steps you need to do.

## Changes
Skip to the first version that is above the version that you used before starting the migration:

Changes introduced in:

- [2.0.0-DEV-98](#200-dev-98)
- [2.0.0-DEV-238](#200-dev-238)
- [2.0.0-DEV-337](#200-dev-337)

### 2.0.0-DEV-98
All existing RPGMenu users must update their RPGMenu config file. Simply rename it from `rpgmenu.config.yml` to
`menuConfig.yml`.

### 2.0.0-DEV-238
- Ensure your server is running on __java 17__
- Move your current Quests to the folder `BetonQuest/QuestPackages/`, as quests are now loaded from there
- Rename `main.yml` to `package.yml`
- Change the `events.yml`, `objectives.yml`, `conditions.yml`, `journal.yml` and `items.yml` to the following format
  with an extra prefix matching their file name:
  ```YAML
  events:
	myEvent1: ...
	....
  ```
- Change the `conversations` and `menus` to the following format with an extra prefix matching there type and the file
  name:
  ```YAML
  conversations:
	ConversationName:
	  NPC_options: ....
	  ....
  ```
  or alternatively:
  ```YAML
  conversations.ConversationName:
	NPC_options: ....
	....
  ```
- Quest packages can now contain nested quest packages in sub folders. You can also have any file and folder structure
  with any file and folder names you want. Only the `package.yml` is reserved as indicator for a quest
  package. [DOCS](../Reference.md#packages)

### 2.0.0-DEV-337
- All your static events need to be converted to the new schedules system.
  The [`realtime-daily`](../Schedules.md#daily-realtime-schedule-realtime-daily) schedule makes this easy:
  ```YAML title="Old Syntax"
  static:
	'09:00': beton
	'11:23': some_command,command_announcement
  ```
  ```YAML title="New Syntax"
  schedules:
	betonAt09: #(1)!
	  type: realtime-daily #(2)!
	  time: '09:00' #(3)!
	  events: beton #(4)!
	cmdAt1123:
	  type: simple
	  time: '11:23'
	  events: some_command,command_announcement
  ```

	1. A name for the new schedule.  
	  Can be anything you want for organizing your schedules.

	2. The type schedule `realtime-daily` was created for easy updating.   
	  It behaves just like the old static events.

	3. The former key is now the time value.  
	  You still have to put it in 'quotes'.

	4. The former value is now the events value.
